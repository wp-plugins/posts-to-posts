Create connections between posts

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to create relationships between posts of different types. The relationships are stored in the postmeta table.

To register a connection type, write:

`
function my_connection_types() {
    p2p_register_connection_type('book', 'author');
}
add_action('init', 'my_connection_types', 100);
`
<br>

See [available functions](http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/posts-to-posts/trunk/api.php).


== Installation ==

You can either install it automatically from the WordPress admin, or do it manually:

1. Unzip the "Posts 2 Posts" archive and put the folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).
1. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
